2024 DSA210 Project - The Credit Card Statement Analysis - Sude Karaahmet

Aim of this project is to analyze my credit card statements with seperating them into four groups: cosmetics, food, clothing and transportation. 

I will collect the data from the mobile application of my banking company. The data initially consists of five columns but the ones relevant to this project are the first(date of the purchase), second(the business) and the third columns(the cost). Date of the purchase is essential because, purchases that are done with installement shopping are cut in seperate months with their date as the time of the initial purchase, I believe that showing items purchased with installement at the month that they were initially purchased is more realistic. 

I plan to show the percentage of the purchases betweeen these four groups within the month, compare the percentages betweeen months of the year, compare the initial costs of these groups between months.
